# ublock-filters

# Description

This is just a collection of random ublock origin filters that I use above and beyond the filters available within the addon itself.

## NOTE: I did not create these.

IANAL but since its pretty much just a list of third party servers/urls to block content from and was found on public forums like reddit, I am 99.9999% sure there is nothing copyrightable about this and it would fall under public domain/fair use.

However, I do believe in giving credit where it's due and try to link to the source where I found them whenever possible. 

The links to the pages are included as comments in the file itself.
